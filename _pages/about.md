A budding data scientist, currently focused on deep learning (with even more focus on computer vision).

I've won a silver medal in `UW-Madison GI Tract Segmentation competition` and implemented some general projects in various domains while building my knowledge base.

I'm originally a pharmacist, so I still find myself more prone to work on competitions and problems rooted in the medical domain, but I'm open to work in any domain that I find interesting.
